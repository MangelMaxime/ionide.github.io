# Getting Started

As Ionide is built on Atom, you may also want to peruse their [Getting Started documentations](https://atom.io/docs)

The easiest way to get Ionide is to install it from Atom itself. In Atom, open the **Settings** pane and navigate to the **Install** tab. There, you can search for *ionide-installer* package and click **Install** button to install it.

Alternatively, if you are more comfortable using the command line, you can install it using *apm*:

~~~
apm install ionide-installer
~~~

The first time you start Atom after installing the *ionide-installer* package, you will have to wait a few seconds for the installer to determine which Ionide packages it needs to install.

Also, integration with project scaffolding, requires having [*generator-fsharp*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-fsharp) installed - please follow instructions on the *generator-fsharp* page to install it.
